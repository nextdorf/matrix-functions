The krylov space is a vector space generated by a square matrix and the Cayley-Hamilton theorem which states that every square matrix is a root of its own characteristic polynomial. From this it follows that $A^n$ is a linear combination of $\unicode{x1D7D9}=A^0,\ A,\ A^2,\ \dots,\ A^{n-1}$ and therefore every polynomial in A is such a linear combination:

$$
A^m = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \alpha_{mk} A^k
$$

It turns out that $\alpha_{mk}$ only depends on the eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\ \dots,\ \lambda_n$. Because of this every matrix function can be expressed in the krylov space if the function is analytical in the eigenvalues:

$$
A^m = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} A^k \sum_{j=0}^k \Lambda_j  \beta \cdot \lambda^{(m+j-k-1)}\\
f(A) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} A^k \sum_{j=0}^k \Lambda_j \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i \lambda_i^{j-k-1} f(\lambda_i)
$$
