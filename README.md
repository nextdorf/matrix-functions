The krylov space is a vector space generated by a square matrix and the cayley-hamilton theorem
which states that every square matrix is a root of its own characteristic polynomial. From this
it follows that A^n is a linear combination of $1=A^0, A, A^2, ..., A^(n-1)$ and therefore every
polynomial in A is such a linear combination.

\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}
